# WabiScript.lrplugin

**WabiScript** is a contemplative Lightroom Classic plugin that transforms image metadata into poetic, persona-driven captions using AI. Each phrase is shaped by the spirit of Zen—elegant, evocative, and ephemeral.

## 🌿 Why WabiScript?

Unlike conventional captioning tools, WabiScript:

- Draws inspiration from Zen aesthetics and wabi-sabi imperfection
- Offers persona modes like *Quiet Monk*, *Ink River*, and *First Bloom*
- Balances metadata with imagination to evoke—not describe—each photo

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open Lightroom Classic → `File > Plug-in Manager`
3. Click `Add` and select `WabiScript.lrplugin`
4. Configure your `secrets.lua` with your OpenAI key (see `secrets.lua.example`)

## 🧠 Persona Prompting

Each caption is guided by a persona prompt. Try adapting one:

> *"You are a wandering monk who expresses emotions through metaphor, describing images like fleeting dreams."*

## ✨ Coming Soon
